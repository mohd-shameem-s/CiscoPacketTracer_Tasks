# Cisco Packet Tracer Networking Tasks

This repository contains a series of hands-on networking tasks built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. These exercises are designed to help students and networking enthusiasts practice key concepts in computer networking, including IP addressing, routing protocols, VLANs, DHCP, NAT, and network security.

| File Name                      | Description                               |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Basic_IP_Configuration.pkt`  | Setup of PCs and switches with static IPs |
| `Static_Routing_Implementation.pkt` | Routing between multiple networks using static routes |
| `VLAN_Setup_and_Configuration.pkt` | VLAN creation and inter-VLAN routing setup |
| `Dynamic_Routing_with_OSPF.pkt` | Configure OSPF for dynamic route sharing |
| `DHCP_Server_Configuration.pkt` | Automate IP addressing with DHCP |
| `Access_Control_Lists.pkt`     | Implement ACLs for traffic control       |
| `Network_Address_Translation.pkt` | NAT setup to enable internet access     |
| `Advanced_Network_Services.pkt` | Additional tasks like SSH, DNS, etc.     |

> ⚠️ *File names above assume you renamed the original `Level1.pkt` to `Level8.pkt` as described.*

## 🛠 Requirements

- [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) (Version 8.0 or higher recommended)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohd-shameem-s/CiscoPacketTracer_Tasks.git
   ```
2. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Open any `.pkt` file of your choice to explore and experiment.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement IP addressing and subnetting.
- Configure static and dynamic routing protocols.
- Use VLANs and trunking to segment networks.
- Deploy DHCP for dynamic IP assignment.
- Secure network segments using ACLs.
- Practice NAT for private-to-public IP conversion.
- Set up services like SSH, DNS, and web servers.
